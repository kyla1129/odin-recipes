    <h1>ADOBO</h1>

    <h2>Decription</h2>
    <p>Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And Iâ€™ve got to say, itâ€™s definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are other renditions of adobo. 
        Be prepared to do some marinating, but if you are in a rush, you have to do it for just 1 hour. After that, you can start working on your stew! We just need to combine our ingredients, and let them simmer for some time. Making adobo really is not as difficult as it may seem!
