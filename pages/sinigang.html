        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is most often associated with tamarind (sampalok), although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent. It is one of the popular viands in Philippine cuisine. Other versions of the dish derive their
        sourness from native fruits like calamansi, guava, or santol. Others may use vinegar, unripe mango, or other ingredients. It is one of the most popular and traditional Filipino dishes, and is seen by some as the Philippine national dish.</p> <br>
